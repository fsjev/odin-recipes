    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Grease the baking sheet. Brush a rimmed baking sheet with olive oil.
Make the dough. Either use our easy pizza dough or your own favorite recipe.
Stretch the dough. Use your hands to stretch the pizza dough into the corners and up the sides of the baking sheet. Let stand for 30 minutes then stretch again. Use a fork to pierce the pizza dough all over.
Add the toppings. Brush the dough with pizza sauce. Top with half of the cheese, all of the ham, pineapple, bell pepper, and red onion. Sprinkle with remaining cheese.
Bake. Place the baking sheet on a hot stone and bake at 450F for 20 to 25 minutes. The crust should be puffed and golden brown. Remove from the oven, let rest for 10 minutes, sprinkle with a bit of red pepper flakes, slice and enjoy!
