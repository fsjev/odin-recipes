    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Brown the beef and veggies. Brown the ground beef and onion with bit of olive oil in a nonstick skillet. Drain off the fat and stir in the garlic, red pepper flakes, and a pinch of salt and pepper.
Add in the sauce ingredients and pasta. Add marinara sauce, beef broth, and pasta to the skillet. Mix to combine, making sure the pasta is fully submerged in the liquid.
Simmer. After mixture begins to bubble, reduce heat to a simmer, cover and cook for about 15-18 minutes until pasta is tender, stirring occasionally (about every 5 minutes) so the pasta doesn't stick and the meat mixture doesn't scorch on the pan.
Add in the cheeses. Remove from heat and stir in half of the mozzarella and parmesan until combined, then sprinkle the remaining cheeses on top.
Top with ricotta. Dot heaping tablespoons of the ricotta all over the mixture. Cover and let stand for 3 to 5 more minutes until cheese melts.
Serve. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley and enjoy with garlic bread!
